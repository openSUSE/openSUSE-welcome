            <h2>Cinnamon 2.0</h2>
            <p>This new major release of Cinnamon includes many great features. It supports better edge tiling and snapping of windows, includes sound effects, better user management, system tray support for file operations, as well as better localisation and date formats. Under the hood, Cinnamon is now no-longer a frontend on top of GNOME, but rather a desktop in its own right built on GNOME technologies such as GTK and Clutter. Refer to the <a href="http://segfault.linuxmint.com/2013/10/cinnamon-2-0-released/">Cinnamon Release Announcement</a> for more details.</p>

            <h2>Xfce 4.10</h2>
            <p>This release mainly focused on polishing the desktop and improving the user experience in various ways. The application finder has been completely rewritten and now supports creating custom actions matching a prefix or regex pattern. The Panel has seen improvements including a Deskbar mode where the panel is aligned vertically but the plugins are laid out horizontally which works really well on systems with wide screens.
